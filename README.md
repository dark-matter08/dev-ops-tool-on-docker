# DevOps Tools - All to be operated on docker

Hi, I am Nde Lucien, and this is a project I am doing while taking a dev ops course. in order to maximize resources and to be able to follow up on all the information provided in the course, i am attempting to run all tasks and run all tools on a single server will all the tools running on docker to simulate different environments and not totally corrupt my main working server environment with unnecessary installations and set up.

I am making this project Open source so that it can help some other beginner with limited resources to be able to follow along and test their knowledge on all docker tools. also maybe some other experienced devs can hop on the project and contribute to it making it a full blown open source project
